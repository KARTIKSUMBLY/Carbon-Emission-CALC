Here’s a sample `README.md` file for **Eco Bytes**, a program that calculates the carbon emissions of all the websites used:

```markdown
# Eco Bytes 🌱

Eco Bytes is a program designed to estimate the carbon emissions associated with the websites you use. By understanding the environmental impact of your digital activities, you can make informed decisions to reduce your carbon footprint.

---

## 🌟 Features
- **Carbon Emission Calculation:** Estimate the carbon emissions for individual websites based on their energy consumption.
- **Data Insights:** Provides a breakdown of the energy usage and emissions for each website.
- **Eco-Friendly Tips:** Offers recommendations for reducing your digital carbon footprint.
- **Simple Interface:** Easy-to-use design for users of all technical levels.

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KARTIKSUMBLY/Carbon-Emission-CALC.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Carbon-Emission-CALC
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python eco_bytes.py
   ```
2. Enter the URLs of the websites you'd like to analyze.
3. View the calculated emissions and suggestions to reduce your impact.

## 📊 How It Works

Eco Bytes calculates carbon emissions by:
1. **Analyzing Website Traffic:** Determines the amount of data transferred for each site.
2. **Energy Consumption Estimates:** Combines data transfer rates with average server energy consumption.
3. **Carbon Footprint Conversion:** Translates energy usage into carbon dioxide equivalent emissions (CO₂e).

## 📖 Example

```bash
$ python eco_bytes.py
Enter website URL (or type 'done' to finish): https://example.com
Enter website URL (or type 'done' to finish): https://another-site.com
Enter website URL (or type 'done' to finish): done

Results:
1. https://example.com - 0.50 kg CO₂e
2. https://another-site.com - 1.25 kg CO₂e

Recommendations:
- Reduce video streaming on high-emission sites.
- Prefer energy-efficient hosting providers.
```
